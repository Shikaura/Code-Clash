# Code Clash Repository

Welcome to the Code Clash Repository! This is a collection of programming projects created by saltyniggo and Shikaura for our periodic programming challenges. 

## Overview
As programming enthusiasts, we enjoy challenging ourselves to create programs that solve various problems and explore different programming languages, tools, and frameworks. For each challenge, we agree on a specific problem to solve or feature to implement, and then we go off and write our own solutions. Once we're finished, we compare our solutions and discuss our thought processes, code structure, and any lessons learned along the way.

## Contents
This repository contains our past and present programming challenges, organized by date and challenge topic. Each challenge folder includes the problem statement, any relevant resources or documentation, and our individual solutions in separate directories.


Happy programming!
